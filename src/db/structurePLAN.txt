I need to explain the structure for the data and data types.
I will use the following template to describe the different data types.

TYPE
  Description

  { model }

------------------
QUESTION
  This will identify the type of question, points, websites used on, and correct answer if it has one.

  { 
    _id : Num, (gets made by MongoDb)
    text : Str,
    type : Str, (Multiple choice, short answer, paragraph, comment, put-in-order, scales (ex - 1-5), graph (future release))
    answers : [ {
      answer : Str || Num,
      isCorrect: Bool,
      image : Str?
      }],
    points : Num,
    image: Str??,
    websitesUsedOn : [Str],
    isPublic: Bool
  }

---

QUESTION_SETS
  This will keep track of the various websites and associated questions.

  {
    _id: Str,
    title: Str,
    websitesUsedOn: [Str],
  }

---

USER
  This will define the basic information for the user profile.

  { 
    _id: Num,
    username: Str,    // need to trim when created
    password: Str,
    email: Str,
    tokens: [Str],
    info: {
      firstName: Str,
      lastName: Str,
      birthday: Str,
    },
    createdQuestionSets: [Str = set IDs],
    answeredQuestionSets: [
                            { questionSetID : Str,
                              selectedAnswers : [Str],
                              feedback: [{
                                questionID : Str,
                                text: Str
                              }]
                          }]
  }

CLASS
  This will organize groups of students and teachers

  {
    title: Str,
    description: Str,
    QuestionSetsAssigned: [ { questionSet: _id, 
                              assignedDate: Date,
                              dueDate: Date}],
    admin: [user _ids],
    students: [{_id: user _ids, hasJoined: Boolean }],
    _id: Object_Id,
    createdAt: Timestamp
  }
